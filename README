== Welcome to myLang

myLang is a Rails application which helps studying languages. 
You can enter the words/expressions you are studying, then play quiz by answering random questions.
Expressions can be grouped by tagging, e.g. Lesson1, Lesson2, ...
You can see the expressions missed most often, also play quiz using these expressions.

A test app is online at mylang.heroku.com.

Planned features/bugs can be seen here: https://github.com/bdomokos74/myLang/issues
